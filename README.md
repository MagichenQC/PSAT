# PSAT
A copy of / unofficial repository for the Power Systems Analysis Toolbox by Federico Milano

The official webpage is [http://faraday1.ucd.ie/psat.html](http://faraday1.ucd.ie/psat.html)

This repository is started from the official version 2.1.10.

As modifications are made, they will be indicated in the source files as required by the license (GPL). The modifications can also be identified using Git of course.

# Goals

The hope is that Github will prove to be a better platform for the community than the official yahoo groups page which is in my personal view an out-dated place for scientific software developers.
